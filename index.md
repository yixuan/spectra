# Spectra

Spectra stands for **Sp**arse **E**igenvalue **C**omputation **T**oolkit
as a **R**edesigned **A**RPACK. It is a C++ library for large scale eigenvalue
problems, built on top of [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org),
an open source linear algebra library.

Spectra is implemented as a header-only C++ library, whose only dependency,
Eigen, is also header-only. Hence Spectra can be easily embedded in
C++ projects that require calculating eigenvalues of large matrices.

The development page of Spectra is
[https://github.com/yixuan/spectra/](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra/).

### Key Features

- Calculates a specified number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a large square matrix
- High performance. In most cases faster than ARPACK
- Header-only. Easy to be embedded into other projects
- Supports symmetric/general, dense/sparse matrices
- Elegant and user-friendly API with great flexibility
- Convenient and powerful R interface - The [RSpectra](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RSpectra)
package

### Relation to ARPACK

[ARPACK](http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/) is a software written in
FORTRAN for solving large scale eigenvalue problems. The development of
Spectra is much inspired by ARPACK, and as the whole name indicates,
Spectra is a redesign of the ARPACK library using C++ language.

In fact, Spectra is based on the algorithms described in the
[ARPACK Users' Guide](http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/UG/ug.html),
but it does not use the ARPACK code, and it is **NOT** a clone of ARPACK for C++.
In short, Spectra implements the major algorithms in ARPACK,
but Spectra provides a completely different interface, and it does not
depend on ARPACK.

### Documentation

See the [Quick Start](quick-start.html) page for some minimal examples that demonstrate the
basic use of Spectra.

The complete [API Reference](doc/index.html) generated by
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) is also available,
including all the background knowledge, example code and class APIs.

The reference for the [RSpectra](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RSpectra) package
can be found in the [R Interface](r-interface.html) page.
